# Windows and Mac OS X dependencies package for CEGUI

This package contains source code and a custom cmake build environment for the
majority of the optional dependency libraries that can be utilised by various
parts of the 'Crazy Eddie's GUI System' (CEGUI) project.

## Available branches and versions

- The CEGUI-dependencies repository consists of multiple branches:
    - `v0-8` is meant to be used with CEGUI releases 0.x, as well as with CEGUI development branches `v0-8` and `v0`. As this branch is ABI compatible, it is possible to replace CEGUI-dependencies dynamic libraries from a specific revision in this branch with another revision in this branch, without having to rebuild the project.

    - `default` is meant to be used with the CEGUI development branch `default`. This branch may break ABI and API compatibility between any 2 revisions in this branch, or between any revision in this branch and a revision in the `v0-8` branch. That means if you switch between revisions you'll have to rebuild your project. Normally you'll only want to use this branch if you're using CEGUI branch `default`.

---

Note that none of the included source packages are in totally pristine and
unmodified form - for example, each package will contain a CEGUI-BUILD
directory that contains - at least - the custom CMakeLists.txt file.

Certain source files are also modified:

* DevIL (IL lib) files were patched to compile with the included libpng 1.4.7.
* Freetype was modified to be able to build as a DLL.
* jpeg library was modified to be able to build as a DLL.
* libtiff was modified to be able to build as a DLL.
* Some packages contain additional config header files which we copy into place
  for OS X, this is done to specify pre-configured settings and replaces an
  invocation of some ./configure script (or similar).

There may be other modifications not explicitly mentioned here, most are
identified in the original files by way of a comment containing "CEGUI"
somewhere, though it is possible - or even likely - that some modifications
are missing such identification, and this notification should suffice to
say that these libs are *not* the original code - to guarantee you're using
the original, umodified, code you should download your own copies of the
original source and perform your own build.

# Cross-compiling

CEGUI dependencies can be cross-compiled from Linux to Windows. In order to do that, you need to configure a cross-compile file and invoke that using CMake. An example of such file is the following:

```CMake
# the name of the target operating system
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

# which compilers to use for C and C++
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)
SET(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)

# here is the target environment located
SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /usr/i686-w64-mingw32 ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/install)

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search
# programs in the host environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

To invoke it you need to execute:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cross-compile.cmake ..
```
